        <section>
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Easy Dictionary, a simple and user-friendly mobile application designed to help you find word
                meanings instantly. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy
                Policy explains how our app handles data, what information (if any) we collect, and how we ensure your
                security while using our services.<br><br>Since Easy Dictionary does not require user registration,
                login,
                or personal data submission, our app is designed with privacy in mind. We believe in providing a safe
                and ad-free experience where users can simply search for word meanings without concerns about data
                tracking or privacy breaches.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p> Easy Dictionary does not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII).
                <br>Note: If the app integrates analytics in future updates, we will ensure they are anonymized and
                used only for performance improvements.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>To fetch definitions, Easy Dictionary relies on a third-party dictionary API. This API processes search
                queries and returns word definitions but does not collect or store user information. The external
                dictionary API may log generic information such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of requests made (for service monitoring).</li>
                <li>Generic device data (e.g., Android/iOS) to optimize API performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not control the privacy practices of third-party API providers. Please refer to their Privacy
                Policy
                for further details.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
            <p>Easy Dictionary does not request access to sensitive device permissions such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Location</li>
                <li> Contacts</li>
                <li> Camera</li>
                <li> Storage</li>
                <li> Microphone</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This ensures complete privacy and prevents any unauthorized data access.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>5.Advertisements and Analytics</h2>
            <p> Easy Dictionary is ad-free. We do not use third-party ad networks, so no personal data is shared with
                advertisers.<br> We do not use intrusive analytics tools like Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel.
                However, we may implement anonymous analytics in the future to understand app performance, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Number of searches per day</li>
                <li>Most commonly searched words (without storing user identity)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If analytics are added, users will be informed in future updates.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>6. Data Security and Retention</h2>
            <p>Since Easy Dictionary does not store any user data, there is no risk of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Data breaches</li>

                <li> Unauthorized access</li>

                <li> Selling or sharing of personal information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our app operates on a real-time request-response basis. Every word search is processed instantly via
                the API and is not stored anywhere.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changes in app features</li>
                <li>Compliance with legal requirements</li>
                <li>Enhancements in privacy measures</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If major changes occur, we will notify users via an in-app message or update the Play Store description.
                Your continued use of the app after updates means you accept the revised policy. </p>
